# Just Another STM32L152 Blinky Example

I fail to run libopencm3-exampleas on my STM32L152 Discovery, and probe-rs is too complex to build for my old computer. So here is a frankenstein example for this good old board in 2024.

- stm32.ld is from [antongus/stm32-ld-scripts](https://github.com/antongus/stm32-ld-scripts/tree/master)
- blinky.s is from [BobBurns/blinky.s](https://gist.github.com/BobBurns/bb601d3432650073a8b4)

Because BobBurns doesn't provide any LICENSE in his gist, I will leave this repo UNLICENSED.
